## PAGE TABLE MANAGEMENT

### DATA STRUCTURES

> `struct` member, global or static variable, `typedef`, or
> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

```c
// Supplemental page 
struct page
{
  void *uaddr; // user virtual address for this page
  struct frame *frame; // corresponding frame. if null, page is not in memory
  bool rw;       // is writable
  bool is_stack; // used to check stack growth

  struct hash_elem page_table_elem; // for page_table
};

struct frame
{
  struct hash_elem frame_table_elem; // for frame_table
  void *kpage; // kernel virtual address for this frame
  struct page *upage; // corresponding page.
  struct thread *owner; // thread that owns this frame

  int second_change; // for Second Change algorithm
};

static struct hash frame_table; // The frame table
struct lock frame_global_lock; // Ensure synchronization

struct thread
{
    // ... Omit other members
    struct hash page_table; // Supplemental page table
    void *esp; // User stack pointer. Saved when interrupt occurs.
};
```

### ALGORITHMS

> A2: In a few paragraphs, describe your code for accessing the data
> stored in the SPT about a given page.

Our SPT is a hash table.

First, we find the page in the SPT. 

If the page is in memory, i.e. `page->frame != NULL`, we can directly access the data in the page.

If the page is in swap, we load the page from swap disk to memory, and then access the data in the page.

If the page is a mmap and not in memory. We load the page from file to memory, and then access the data in the page.

> A3: How does your code coordinate accessed and dirty bits between
> kernel and user virtual addresses that alias a single frame, or
> alternatively how do you avoid the issue?

In our implementation, we do not allow aliasing. We avoid accessing the memory using kernel virtual address. Kernel virtual address is only used to initialize the page.

### SYNCHRONIZATION

> A4: When two user processes both need a new frame at the same time,
> how are races avoided?

We use a global lock `frame_global_lock` to ensure synchronization.

Before a thread operates on the frame table, it must acquire the lock. After the operation, it must release the lock. 

### RATIONALE

We use a hash table. So that given a virtual address, we can find the corresponding physical address in $O(1)$ time.

## PAGING TO AND FROM DISK

### DATA STRUCTURES

> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct` or
> `struct` member, global or static variable, `typedef`, or
> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

```c
struct page
{
    // ... Omit other members
  size_t swap_index; // where is this page in swap disk. when this page is not
                     // in swap, swap_index=BITMAP_ERROR
};
```

### ALGORITHMS

> B2: When a frame is required but none is free, some frame must be
> evicted.  Describe your code for choosing a frame to evict.

We use Second Change Algorithm to choose a frame.

All pages are considered in a round robin matter, but one page be relaced only when visit it at second time. When accessing a page, the flag will be reset.

> B3: When a process P obtains a frame that was previously used by a
> process Q, how do you adjust the page table (and any other data
> structures) to reflect the frame Q no longer has?

When a frame is not belong to a process Q, we use ``frame_free`` to clean this frame, and set ``page->frame = NULL``

> B4: Explain your heuristic for deciding whether a page fault for an

> the page that faulted.

If the address is not lower than PYHS_BASE and not higher than ``esp-32``, and the stack is not larger than 8MB,  we think it is a valid stack address, and extend the stack. Otherwise it not cause a stack growth.

### SYNCHRONIZATION

We use a global lock `frame_global_lock` to ensure synchronization.

Before a thread operates on the frame table, it must acquire the lock. After the operation, it must release the lock. 

So P and Q won't have a race.

We use a global lock `frame_global_lock` to ensure synchronization.

Before a thread operates on the frame table, it must acquire the lock. After the operation, it must release the lock. 

So Q will wait until P finishes reading file.

We use the page fault to bring in pages.
When a page fault occurs, in the interrupt handler, we first check if the page is in the SPT. If it is, we load the page from file or swap disk to memory. Then we return to the interrupted instruction.
Otherwise, we think user gives syscall with invalid virtual address.

## MEMORY MAPPED FILES

### DATA STRUCTURES

> C1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct` or
> `struct` member, global or static variable, `typedef`, or
> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

```c
struct thread

    // ... Omit other members
    struct list mmap_list; // List of mmaped files
    mapid_t next_mapid;
};

struct page
{
  // ... Omit other members
  struct file *file; // Indicate whether the page is a mmap page
  off_t file_offset;
  size_t file_size; // [file_offset, file_offset + file_size) is mapped to this
                    // page
};
```

### ALGORITHMS

> processes differ between swap pages and other pages.

In lazy creation, we check `file` attribute to determine whether the page is a mmap page.
If yes, we use `fread` to load the content of the file and use `memset` to set the rest of the page to zero.

In swap, we check `file` attribute to determine whether the page is a mmap page.
If yes, instead of write it to the swap disk. We write it directly to the file it maps.
So the `swap_index` of a mmap page is always `BITMAP_ERROR`.

> C3: Explain how you determine whether a new file mapping overlaps
> any existing segment.

We use a for loop to check every address.
If it overlaps a existing page in spte, mmap syscall is terminated.

We implement stack growth and swap first. Adding mmap doesn't modify the code much.
Because in mmap syscall, we just create many mmap pages in spte without reading the content of the file.
Mmap pages share the same page fault handler with the stack growth. The only thing we need to do is to add some if else.
Swap is similar.
